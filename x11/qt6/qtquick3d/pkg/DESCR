Qt Quick 3D provides a high-level API for creating 3D content and 3D user
interfaces based on Qt Quick. Rather than using an external engine which
creates syncing issues, and additional layers of abstraction, we provide
extensions to the existing Qt Quick Scene Graph for spatial content, and a
renderer for that extended scene graph. When using the spatial scene graph it
is also be possible to mix Qt Quick 2D content with 3D content.

Open WebRTC Toolkit with Telegram desktop patches.

WebRTC is an open source project that enables web browsers with
Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple Javascript
APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this
purpose.  WebRTC implements the W3C's proposal for video conferencing
on the web.

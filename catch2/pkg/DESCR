Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++, but it also provides
basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple BDD macros.

Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and natural. Tests
autoregister themselves and do not have to be named with valid identifiers,
assertions look like normal C++ code, and sections provide a nice way to
share set-up and tear-down code in tests.

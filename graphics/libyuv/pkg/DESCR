libyuv is an open source project that includes YUV conversion and scaling
functionality. Converts all webcam formats to YUV (I420). Convert YUV to
formats for rendering/effects. Rotate by 90 degrees to adjust for mobile
devices in portrait mode. Scale YUV to prepare content for compression, with
point, bilinear or box filter.

REQUIRED prior to submission:

* starting tdesktop-3.3.0 linked against tg_owt using external libyuv shows
  this on startup but otherwise runs fine:
  telegram-desktop:/usr/local/lib/libyuv.so.0.0: undefined symbol 'jpeg_resync_to_restart'

OPTIONAL/nice-to-have later on:

* replace libyuv bundle with new port
  (needs porting, no explicit upstream support, iirc)
* replace rnnoise bundle with audio/rnnoise
  (no explicit upstream support)

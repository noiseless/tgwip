REQUIRED for prior to port submission:

* clarify api id/hash situation:  get explicit confirmation that we can use
  some other package's id/hash or create our own (*not* linked to a private person)

OPTIONAL/nice-to-have later on:

* replace old minizip bundle with updated archivers/minizip
  (API changed, needs patching, best wait for upstream to do so)
* test audio/video calls in various network setups:
  ipv4 only, ipv6 only, nat64/dns64, 464xlat clat, sock5 proxy set inside tdesktop
* enable dbus integration (probably brings more control over notification)
* replace rlottie bundle with new port
